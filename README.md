# Masked Script

This is a Python Automation Script that displays the Levels of Grass, Mold, Ragweed, and Tree Pollen in the Air at a specific time.

I wanted to create this because my allergies in the recent years have been horrible and I wanted to know if I should mask my face in order to protect myself. So an automation would make that easier for me.

I used libraries like requests, PySimpleGUI and more to create this automation. I am getting my weather data from Accuweather through an API because, in my eyes, Accuweather is very reliable.
